# Ofuscator Multi-platform
It is a source code obfuscator written in Python v3.8.5 with graphical interface that allows to obfuscate variables, names and references of a source code or a set of source codes at once, it is very effective to obfuscate entire projects with names and references the same in different files.

It works for Linux and Windows platforms, .run and .exe executables respectively. Coming soon for Mac OS.

It allows to pass all variable names and references to a list and choose the two characters or character strings to be used for binary obfuscation.

The task is not to encrypt the variables but to transform them into strings of equal length so that visually they are very difficult to distinguish.

It has a plus for languages without indentation (distinction of blocks without tabulation) as Java - JavaScript - C - C++ - C# - PHP that allows to group all the code in a single line (For this functionality avoid comments).

It is advisable to use in the binaries, characters that are very similar visually.

Example: Binary A = l Binary B = I
